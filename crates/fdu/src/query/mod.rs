//! Queries over a built index: what to select, which roll-ups to report, and the value
//! grammars both are written in.
//!
//! The module is deliberately free of filesystem access and of the `cli` feature. A query
//! is a pure function of an [`Index`](crate::Index) and a request, so the CLI, the Rust
//! API, and the Python bindings all compose the same types rather than reimplementing
//! selection three times — and so a report can never quietly become a producer of state.
