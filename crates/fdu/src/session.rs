//! A live session: an index, a watcher, and the query they answer together.
//!
//! A watch run is the same query as a one-shot run, re-evaluated as changes arrive —
//! there is no separate watch grammar. This module owns that composition so the CLI loop
//! and the Python iterator are both thin consumers rather than two implementations of
//! the same coordination.
//!
//! # Detection is event-driven
//!
//! Changes arrive from the operating system's own notification backend, never from
//! polling: `FSEvents` on macOS, inotify on Linux, `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on Windows. An
//! idle tree costs no filesystem work at all. Events are hints, so each coalesced path is
//! verified with one fresh stat before it becomes a delta, and the interval a caller
//! passes throttles only how often aggregate views are re-rendered — it plays no part in
//! detection.
