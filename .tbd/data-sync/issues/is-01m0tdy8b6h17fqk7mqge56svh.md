At PR 47 head e658915, the core ReadBundle captures clock, scope, freshness, and projections under one guard, but PyIndex.read releases that guard and then locks RunState to attach complete, source, and errors. A refresh can therefore pair old data with new status or new data with old status. ReadRequest also has no requested clock or version, so a multi-page catalog can silently mix states after a mutation. Fix: return lifecycle, coverage, freshness, source, progress, and typed issues from the same versioned engine image; add an expected session and clock to a read and return VersionUnavailable on mismatch. A provider may retain only the current version: page two either sees the exact version or fails, never advances silently. Add forced interleaving and mutation-between-pages tests. This is follow-up to closed fdu-2ivi and should precede the wider algebra in fdu-samw. Review finding FDU47-R4.

## Notes

ITEM 2 RESOLVED by fdu-jxs0. The remaining typed-envelope and fixed-as_of work is still open. Exact-head follow-up at PR #47 4eac1b2: browser_provider.recent_page does not implement recent-result paging. after and limit are the child-page arguments on index.read(children_of=Path()), while the FILES report is independently truncated by Selection.limit and has no continuation. The call also omits expected, and the smoke test invokes only one 50-row result, so it cannot prove advancing pages, one version, or exact lossless remainder. This confirms rather than closes the native filtered-tree/catalog paging gate. See formal review on PR #47 at this head.
